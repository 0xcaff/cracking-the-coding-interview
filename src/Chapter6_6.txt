This can be solved with induction.

Base Case:
2 blue-eyed people.

If both people are blue eyed, on the first day, they will each realize that
the other has blue eyes, but they won't know anything about their eye color.

If they both haven't left on the second day, it is because they don't know
that they are blue-eyed. They would have left by now if they were sure that
they were blue eyed. The only way for them to be sure they are blue-eyed,
would be for the other person to be non-blue-eyed. Since they didn't leave
and because at least one person is blue-eyed, both people are blue-eyed. For
two people, it takes 2 days for all blue-eyed people to leave.

Recursive Case:
Assuming that for n blue-eyed people, it takes n days for everyone to realize
and leave.

Prove that it will take n + 1 days for n + 1 blue-eyed people to leave.
After the n people have realized that they have blue eyes in n days, they
will leave if you are non-blue eyed.

If you are blue-eyed, they will stay for n + 1 days after which you can leave
because you now know that you are blue-eyed.

Therefore it will take n days where n is the number of blue-eyed people.
