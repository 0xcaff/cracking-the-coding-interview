Since the file is so large, we can't just read it into memory and process it
immediately. Instead, we need to sort it part by part. This is a pretty common
problem called External sorting.

One way to do this is with Merge Sort, splitting the file into something which
fits into memory, sorting those pieces in memory, writing them to temp files.
Then, doing a k-way merge between the pieces.
