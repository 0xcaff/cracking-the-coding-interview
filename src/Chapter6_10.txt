Split the 1k bottles into 10 sets of 100.

Dip the test strips into each of the 100 bottles and submit for testing.

After a week, you'll know which set of 100 bottles is bad.

Split the 100 bottles into 9 sets. Dip the 9 remaining into each set.

After a week, you'll have narrowed it down to 12 bottles.

Repeat twice more.

Once with two bottles in each set and finally once with one bottle in each set.

It will take 4 weeks in the worst case.

There is a better way apparently.
